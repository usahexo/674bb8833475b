<p>According to Reuters, Harman needed just over two hours to rack up her 52nd blackjack, beating the previous record of 51 which was set by American player Rick Ingham in February this year. Ingham was actually in attendance at Caesars Palace on Tuesday to witness Harman’s achievement and he was one of the first to congratulate her.</p>
<p>“I’m really happy for Jennifer,” said Ingham. “She is an amazing player and deserves this world record.”</p>
<p>Harman, who has been playing blackjack since she was just 16 years old, was understandably delighted with her latest achievement. “I’m excited and proud to have held this title for a little while now,” she said. “It feels great to break such an impressive record.”</p>
<p>The mother-of-two is considered one of the greatest blackjack players in the world and has won millions of dollars in prize money over the course of her career. She is also a regular fixture on TV poker tournaments, having appeared on programs such as NBC’s Poker After Dark and Fox Sports Network’s Extreme Poker Showdown.</p>
