The Green-Whites have had their ups and downs in the Bundesliga, but they always remain a feared opponent. Werder Bremen is a club that is known for its offensive and fast brand of football. [+] Their attractive play style has drawn in many fans over the years and this has also been evident with the amount of bets being placed on their matches.</p>
<p>Bremen is not only a team that is popular among punters because of their style of play, but also because they are one of the most consistent clubs in the Bundesliga. This means that you can always count on them to put up a good fight, regardless of who they are playing against. Bettors usually favour betting on Bremen when they are playing against teams from outside of the top four in Germany, as they tend to be more vulnerable against these sides.</p>
<p>When it comes to placing wagers on Werder Bremen, there are a few things that you need to take into account, such as their form, injuries and their opponents’ form. It is also important to look at how much value you can get on a bet before you place your wager.</p>
<p>In order to help you with your Werder Bremen bets, we have compiled some valuable information below. We will take a closer look at their recent performances, highlight some key fixtures and provide our verdict on where the value lies for upcoming matches. So, without further ado, let’s get started!</p>
<p>Recent Form</p>
<p>Werder Bremen have had an inconsistent start to the season after picking up just six points from their first nine fixtures. They currently sit in 12th place in the Bundesliga table and are in need of some victories if they want to move up the standings. [+] Fortunately for them, they have started to pick up some steam recently with two wins and a draw from their last three matches. They will be looking to build on this momentum when they face off against Bayer Leverkusen this weekend.</p>
<p>Key Fixtures</p>
<p>This weekend’s matchup against Bayer Leverkusen will be a crucial one for both teams as they both desperately need all three points. Werder Bremen currently sit four points behind Bayer Leverkusen in the table and are looking to close that gap with a win this weekend. [+] The Green-Whites have had mixed results against Bayer Leverkusen over the years, winning two out of five meetings while losing two and drawing one game apiece. The match should be an entertaining one as both teams like to attack and should provide plenty of goalscoring opportunities. Werder Bremen come into this match as slight underdogs at odds of 3&#x2F;2 (2.50), so there is definitely value to be found there if you fancy them to pull off an upset win.</p>
