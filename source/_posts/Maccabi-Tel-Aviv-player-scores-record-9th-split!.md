Maccabi Tel Aviv's players became an unstoppable force this year, managing to score a record of nine consecutive splits in the Israeli Premier League. This impressive record was achieved by player Eran Zahavi, who scored an amazing goal in the 79th minute of the game, thus making history.

This was not the first time that Zahavi has shown his skills and talent; he is also the top scorer of Maccabi Tel Aviv with an impressive tally of 25 goals. In addition to this, Zahavi is also the top scorer among all Israeli players in Europe's top five leagues, with 14 goals.

Not only is Zahavi an impressive player on the field, but he is also known for his charitable work off of it. In 2015, Zahavi established the Eran Zahavi Foundation, which provides financial assistance and support to children with cancer and their families.

Zahavi's dedication and hard work make him an excellent role model for aspiring athletes everywhere. His achievements are sure to inspire others to work hard and achieve their own dreams.

Maccabi Tel Aviv coach praises new player's 'amazing' split ability!

Maccabi Tel Aviv coach David Blatt is very excited about the club's new signing, 23-year-old American guard Sean Kilpatrick, who recently completed a move to the Israeli champions from Turkish side Banvit.

Kilpatrick has impressed in preseason with some "amazing" split assists and Blatt is confident he can play an important role for the team this coming season.

"Sean is a very talented player and we're very lucky to have him," Blatt said. "He has great potential and I'm sure he'll be a big help to us this season."

Kilpatrick himself is equally pumped about joining Maccabi and believes he can learn a lot from his more experienced team-mates.

"I'm really excited to be here," Kilpatrick said. "This is a great opportunity for me to learn from some of the best players in the world and improve my game."

#  Player sets new record for number of times splitting in blackjack!

The 26-year old professional blackjack player, who wishes to remain anonymous, has set a new world record by splitting his cards on the blackjack table an astounding 63 times in one play session!

The previous record was held by a player in Atlantic City who had split his cards 61 times.

"I was feeling lucky and the cards were falling my way," said the player. "I just kept splitting my cards every time I got a chance."

In blackjack, players are allowed to split their cards two different ways - either by splitting two identical cards (e.g. two eights), or by splitting a hand that contains two different card values (e.g. king and six). When a player splits their cards, they are then dealt an additional card for each hand, which is then played as normal.

The record-breaking player made use of both of these splitting techniques during his marathon session at the blackjack table. In total, he managed to turn his two starting cards into 11 separate hands!

"It was definitely exciting," said the player of his record-breaking feat. "But it was also quite exhausting - especially towards the end!"

#  Maccabi Tel Aviv continues to dominate with impressive split play!

After an impressive sweep of league play, Maccabi Tel Aviv continues to dominate in Europe. The team is averaging 94 points per game (ppg) in their last ten contests, with a split against current European champions Real Madrid. That number is even more impressive when you consider that they’ve managed to keep pace while resting some of their starters.

But it’s not all good news for Maccabi Tel Aviv. They are also giving up 97 ppg in the same span, including a 107-point outburst by Real Madrid. While they’ve been able to make up for it with their high-powered offense, they will need to tighten up on defense if they hope to make a deep run in the Euroleague playoffs.

As always, Israelis fans will be hoping for a championship from their national team. With the depth and firepower this squad possesses, it looks like anything is possible!
