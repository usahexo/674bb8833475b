#  How to quickly and easily reset the credit card slot on your vending machine 

It can be frustrating when your vending machine doesn’t properly accept your credit card. You might think that you need to call a technician in order to fix the problem, but this isn’t always the case. There are a few simple steps that you can take in order to fix the credit card slot on your vending machine.

The first step is to try cleaning the magnetic strip on your credit card. This can be done by using a soft cloth or napkin. Make sure that you don’t use anything that will scratch or damage the strip. If this doesn’t work, then you can try using a paper clip or other metal object to clear any debris from inside the card slot.

If neither of these methods work, then you might need to reset the entire vending machine. In order to do this, you will need to locate the reset button on the machine. It is usually hidden behind a small panel or door. Once you have found it, press and hold the button for several seconds until the machine resets.

If all of these methods fail, then it might be time to call a technician. However, trying these simple steps before calling for help can save you both time and money.
