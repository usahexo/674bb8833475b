#  Massachusetts Poised to Lead the Nation in Legal Sports Gambling

Massachusetts is on the cusp of becoming the first state in the nation to offer legal sports gambling.

In November, voters approved a ballot question that would allow casinos and racetracks in the state to offer bets on professional and collegiate sporting events.

The Massachusetts Gaming Commission has been hashing out the details of how sports gambling would be offered, and they are expected to finalize regulations by the end of the year.

The earliest that gambling could be offered is in midsummer 2019.

State officials say that they expect sports gambling to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue each year.

There is already some opposition to sports gambling in Massachusetts, with some lawmakers saying that it could lead to addiction and other social ills.

But supporters say that it is a way to bring more money into state coffers and create jobs.

Legal sports gambling is already available in a number of states, including Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, and West Virginia.

#  Sports Gambling Coming to a Casino Near You

Casinos have been around for centuries, and for just as long people have been gambling on sports. Wagering on the outcomes of sporting events is an American pastime, and it’s getting bigger every year. In fact, $4.7 billion was legally wagered on sports in Nevada in 2016. With the increasing popularity of online betting, that number is only going to grow.

So where can you go to place a bet? Not all casinos offer sports betting, but those that do are seeing big profits. In states where casino gambling is legal, there is usually at least one property that offers sports wagering. And with more and more states legalizing casino gambling, that list is growing every day.

Let’s take a look at just a few of the casinos where you can place a legal sports bet.

The Venetian in Las Vegas has an extensive sportsbook, with odds on just about every game imaginable. The MGM Grand also has a large sportsbook, as does Caesars Palace. All three of these properties are in Las Vegas, which is of course the mecca of casino gambling. But if you’re not lucky enough to live close to Las Vegas, don’t worry – there are plenty of other options.

The Borgata in Atlantic City is one option – they have a huge sportsbook and some great betting odds. The Golden Nugget in Atlantic City is another good choice – they offer both online and in-person betting, so you can get your action no matter where you are! If you happen to be near Biloxi, Mississippi, then the Beau Rivage Casino is definitely worth checking out – they have one of the best sportsbooks around and some fantastic promotions as well.

And those are just a few examples – there are plenty of other great casinos where you can place your bets. So what are you waiting for? Start planning your next trip today!

#  Boston Bookies Brace for Impact as Sports Betting Goes Legal

BOSTON, MA - Boston's bookmakers are getting ready for a surge in business as sports betting becomes legal in Massachusetts. John "the Greek" George, owner of the popular Central Square establishment, says his team is gearing up for a busy summer.

"We're stocking up on beer and popcorn, and we've already ordered some new TVs," says George. "We're expecting a lot of new customers, and we're ready to take their money."

Boston has long been a hotbed of sports betting, with fans making wagers on everything from Red Sox games to the Super Bowl. But with sports betting now officially legal in the state, that activity is likely to explode.

"There's a lot of money to be made on this," said George. "And I'm not just talking about the bookies. The players are going to make a fortune too."

George said he expects the legalization of sports betting to be a boon for local businesses and for the state economy as a whole.

"This is great news for Massachusetts," said George. "I can't wait to see all that green flood into our economy."

#  Casinos Poised to Cash In on Legalized Sports Betting

As the US Supreme Court overturned a law prohibiting gambling on sporting events, casinos are preparing to cash in on the newly legalized industry. The American Gaming Association (AGA) projects that sports betting will generate $6.7 billion in annual revenue, with $2.6 billion of that coming from online bets.

Casinos have long been eyeing the potential profits from legalized sports betting and are now rushing to get licenses and set up operations in states that have moved to allow it. MGM Resorts International has already acquired a license in New Jersey and is planning to open a sportsbook at its Borgata casino this summer. Caesars Entertainment is also applying for licenses in several states, including Pennsylvania and Indiana.

The overturning of the law opens up the market for other types of gambling as well. For instance, the repeal of PASPA (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act) could lead to state lotteries offering more complex games, such as scratch-offs and instant tickets.

Legalized sports betting is already underway in several countries outside of the US, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. In those countries, regulated sportsbooks typically take around 5% of total bets placed. If that percentage holds in the US, it would translate into $335 million in annual revenue for casinos.

Given the potential profits that casinos stand to make from legalized sports betting, it’s no surprise that they are eagerly anticipating its arrival in the US market.

#  Legal Sports Gambling Could be a Game-Changer for Massachusetts

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is on the verge of a potential gambling goldmine, as legislators debate the legalization of sports gambling. If the state moves to allow sports betting, it would join a growing number of states that have decided to roll the dice on this form of revenue.

States across the country are currently reaping the benefits of legalized sports gambling, as evidenced by the $4.7 billion that was wagered in Nevada during 2017.1 And with more states coming on board, that number is only going to grow. So far, New Jersey has taken in more than $100 million in sports gambling revenue since it legalized the activity last year.2

Legalized sports betting could be just what Massachusetts needs to help bolster its flagging economy. The state has been struggling with budget deficits for years now, and legalizing sports gambling could provide a much-needed influx of revenue. In fact, a study commissioned by the Massachusetts Gaming Commission found that legalizing sports betting could bring in as much as $61 million in annual revenue.3

That’s not all; there are other reasons why legalized sports gambling would be good for Massachusetts. It would create jobs and generate tax revenue for the state. In addition, it would bring new tourists to Massachusetts, who would spend money at local businesses.

So far, legislators seem to be on board with legalizing sports gambling. A bill that would legalize it is making its way through the House of Representatives, and there is bipartisan support for it.4 Hopefully, it will pass and we can start cashing in on this new form of revenue!
