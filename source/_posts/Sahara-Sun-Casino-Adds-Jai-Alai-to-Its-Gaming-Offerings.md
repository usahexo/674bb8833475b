#  Sahara Sun Casino Adds Jai Alai to Its Gaming Offerings

The Sahara Sun Casino, located in the heart of the Nevada desert, has just announced that it will be adding jai alai to its gaming offerings. This comes as great news to fans of the sport, who now have a place to watch and bet on games near them.

Jai alai is a fast-paced ball game that is often compared to tennis or racquetball. The object of the game is to catch a pelota (a hard rubber ball) and then throw it against a wall or fronton (a court) so that it rebounds off and goes back to your opponent. Jai alai is considered one of the most difficult sports to play, due to its speed and precision.

The Sahara Sun Casino has been steadily expanding its gaming options in recent years. The addition of jai alai completes its lineup of table games, slot machines, and poker rooms. It also gives players another opportunity to win some serious cash prizes.

#  Sahara Sun Casino Brings Excitement of Jai Alai to Miami Area

The Sahara Sun Casino has announced it will open a new location in Miami, bringing the excitement of jai alai to the area. Jai alai is a popular sport in Spain and Latin America, and the Sahara Sun Casino’s Miami location will be the only one in North America.

Jai alai is a fast-paced sport that combines elements of handball, basketball, and tennis. Players attempt to catch a ball using a curved wicker basket called a cesta and then throw it back to their opponents as quickly as possible. Points are scored when players either catch or throw the ball past their opponents.

The Sahara Sun Casino’s Miami location will feature 14 courts and will offer both professional and amateur tournaments. Visitors to the casino can also enjoy other casino games such as blackjack, roulette, and poker.

The Sahara Sun Casino’s Miami location is expected to open in early 2019.

#  Jai Alai Comes to Sahara Sun Casino in Miami

Sahara Sun Casino in Miami is pleased to announce the newest addition to its game offerings - jai alai. This ancient Basque game is considered by many to be the fastest sport in the world, and players can now test their skills at our casino.

Jai alai is a form of handball that is played with a hard rubber ball. The object of the game is to catch the ball and then throw it against the front wall of the court so that it rebounds into play. The player then tries to catch the rebound before it bounces a second time, and then throws it against the back wall. Points are scored by either throwing the ball into the opponent's front court or hitting it against one of the walls so that the opponent cannot catch it.

The game originated in Spain and was brought to America by Cuban immigrants in the early 1900s. It quickly became popular in Florida and is now played in casinos all over the country. Jai alai has also gained a following among professional bettors, who appreciate its fast-paced action and high potential payouts.

If you're looking for a new challenge, come down to Sahara Sun Casino and try your hand at jai alai. With stakes ranging from $1 to $100, there's something for everyone!

#  Sahara Sun Casino Adds Another Attraction: JAI ALAI

The Sahara Sun Casino has long been a popular destination for gamblers in the area. With its recent expansion, the casino has become even more of a draw, with new restaurants, bars, and an entertainment area. Now, there is one more reason to visit the Sahara Sun - jai alai.

Jai alai is a fast-paced sport that combines elements of handball and tennis. The object of the game is to throw a ball against a front wall with enough speed and accuracy to make it bounce back to the player. Points are scored by hitting the ball so that it bounces off one or more walls before being caught by the player.

Jai alai has been around for centuries, but it is not commonly seen in the United States. In fact, the only other place in Nevada where you can watch jai alai is at the Tropicana Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. That is about to change, however, as the Sahara Sun Casino begins offering regular jai alai games later this year.

If you are looking for a unique experience and want to see something that you won't find anywhere else in Nevada, be sure to check out jai alai at the Sahara Sun Casino.
