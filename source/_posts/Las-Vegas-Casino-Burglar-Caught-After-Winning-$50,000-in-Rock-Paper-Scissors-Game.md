#  First Ever Casino Opens in Las Vegas… and the Gambling Begins!

July 3, 1955, was a momentous day in Las Vegas and American history. The first ever casino on the Las Vegas Strip, the El Rancho Vegas, opened its doors to much fanfare. The original 24-hour casino boasted a 96-foot long bar, a live orchestra, and 1,000 slot machines. It was an immediate success, with guests arriving by car, bus, train, and plane.

Gambling had been legalized in Nevada just four years earlier in 1951, and casinos were popping up all over the state. In the early days of Nevada gambling, casinos were segregated by race with black patrons relegated to their own establishments. This began to change in 1954 when anti-discrimination laws were passed in the state.

The opening of the El Rancho Vegas was a watershed moment for Las Vegas and for American gambling as a whole. It signaled that gambling was now mainstream and acceptable for everyone. Gambling had come out of the shadows and into the bright lights of the Strip.

The El Rancho Vegas operated until 1960 when it was destroyed by fire. But it was replaced within months by the Stardust Resort & Casino which would become one of the most iconic casinos in Las Vegas history. The momentum that started with the opening of the El Rancho Vegas would continue to build throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s as Las Vegas became known as “Sin City” and “The Gambling Capital of the World”.

#  How to Win at Rock Paper Scissors: Professional Gambler's Secret Revealed



Rock, paper, scissors (RPS) is a two-player game where each player simultaneously produces one of three possible gestures with their hand: a rock, paper, or scissors. The victor is determined by the combination of moves made by both players: a rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

RPS is commonly played in casual situations as a means of settling disputes or deciding who does something. However, it can also be wagered on as a form of gambling. In fact, professional RPS players often make a living from gambling on the game. If you're looking to up your odds of winning when gambling on RPS, read on for some tips from professional gamblers.

The first step to winning at RPS is to understand your opponent. Different people have different tendencies when it comes to choosing their gesture. For example, some people always choose rock, while others always choose scissors. To win against these opponents, you need to be ready with the appropriate countermove.

Another important thing to remember is that not all opponents are predictable. Some players will deliberately switch up their move depending on the situation in order to throw their opponent off guard. In order to beat these players, you need to be able to adapt quickly and make the right move every time.

Finally, don't get discouraged if you lose occasionally. Like any other game, RPS involves chance as well as skill. Just keep practicing and learn from your mistakes, and you'll start winning more often in no time.
