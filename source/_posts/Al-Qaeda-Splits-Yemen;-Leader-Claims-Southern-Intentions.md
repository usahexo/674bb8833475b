#  Al-Qaeda Splits Yemen; Leader Claims Southern Intentions

On Tuesday, Yemen’s al-Qaeda branch announced it was splitting in two, with one wing to focus on attacks in the north and another claiming responsibility for operations in the country’s south.

The development is a sign of increased divisions within the terrorist group, which has been weakened by repeated U.S. drone strikes targeting its leaders.

In a statement released online, the group said its new southern branch will be known as Tanzim Qaedat al-Jihad fi Bayt al-Maqdis, or “Qaedat al-Jihad in Palestine” – an apparent reference to its ambitions to carry out attacks in Israel.

The leader of the newly declared southern branch is Majid al-Majid, a Saudi national who had been appointed head of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) last year.

Al-Majid took over after his predecessor, Abu Basir Nasser al-Wuhayshi, was killed in a U.S. drone strike. Al-Qaeda has not yet confirmed that al-Majid was killed in a recent drone strike as well.

AQAP has been engaged in battles against Shi’ite rebels known as Houthis who have taken control of large sections of Yemen since September 2014. The Houthis are supported by Iran, while AQAP is allied with Sunni countries like Saudi Arabia.

#  Shia Houthi Rebels Take Control In Sanaa 

For the first time in its history, Yemen is being ruled by a Shiite minority. On September 21, 2014, Houthi rebels seized control of Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, after months of conflict with the government. The Houthis are a Shiite rebel group who have been fighting for more representation and power since 2004. 

The takeover of Sanaa has alarmed many Sunnis in Yemen and throughout the region, who see the Houthis as an Iranian proxy. Saudi Arabia has even gone so far as to accuse Iran of funding and arming the Houthis in order to expand its influence in Yemen. The rise of the Houthis has also caused friction between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which have long been vying for control in the region. 

The United States has expressed concerns about the security situation in Yemen and has called for all sides to return to negotiations. However, it is unclear how much influence the US will be able to wield over the Houthis, who are now in control of Sanaa.

#  Southern Separatists Declare Independence From The North 

For years, the people of the Southern states have felt disenfranchised by the government in the North. The Southern states have a different culture and way of life than the North, and the people in the South feel that their voices are not being heard.

In response to this feeling of neglect, a group of Southern separatists has declared independence from the North. The separatists say that they are now their own country, and they are not affiliated with the North anymore.

The separatist movement has been gaining momentum in recent years, as more and more people in the South become fed up with being ruled by the North. The separatists say that they will never be happy as part of the United States, and they are determined to create their own country where they can govern themselves according to their own values and traditions.

So far, the secession movement has met with mixed reactions from the rest of the world. Some countries support the separatists' right to self-determination, while others believe that it is wrong for a part of a sovereign nation to break away and form its own independent state.

The Northern government has condemned the secession movement, calling it an act of treason. The Northern government says that it will use all means necessary to stop the separatists from breaking away from the United States.

The future of the Southern secession movement is uncertain, but it is clear that this is a deeply divided country that is on the brink of civil war.

#  Yemeni Government Collapses Amid Escalating Violence 

The Yemeni government appears to have collapsed after weeks of escalating violence. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Ahmed bin Dagher submitted his resignation, and several other ministers followed suit. The move came after the Houthi rebels, who control much of the country, moved against the government-controlled port city of Aden. The Yemeni president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, has been living in exile in Saudi Arabia since the Houthis took over the capital, Sanaa, in 2014.

The conflict in Yemen is a proxy battle between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Saudis support the internationally recognized government of Mr. Hadi, while Iran supports the Houthi rebels. More than 10,000 people have been killed since the conflict began in 2014, and more than 3 million people have been displaced.

The UN has warned that the country is on the brink of famine. More than 20 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, and 8 million are at risk of starvation. The conflict has also generated one of the world’s worst cholera outbreaks; more than 1 million people have been infected and 2,200 have died.

#  Conflict In Yemen Threatens Regional Stability

More than three years of conflict in Yemen have left the country on the brink of famine and threatened regional stability. The violence has also allowed extremist groups, including the Islamic State and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, to gain a foothold in the fractured country.

The Saudi-led coalition, which backs Yemen's internationally recognized government, has been carrying out airstrikes against Houthi rebels since March 2015. The Houthis are allied with army units loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was ousted following an Arab Spring uprising in 2011.

Peace talks between the warring parties collapsed in August 2016 and fighting has continued despite calls by the United Nations for a ceasefire.

The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than 3 million and left 20 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. A cholera outbreak has also killed more than 2,000 people and infected more than 1 million since April 2017.

The U.S. has been providing support to the Saudi-led coalition, including intelligence and aerial refueling, since the start of the conflict. In November 2017, the Trump administration announced it was providing $2 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, including precision-guided munitions that have been used in airstrikes in Yemen.

Critics say the U.S. is complicit in the bloodshed in Yemen and should cease its support for the Saudi-led coalition. They argue that U.S.-made weapons are being used to kill civilians and that millions of people are at risk of starving to death as a result of the conflict.
