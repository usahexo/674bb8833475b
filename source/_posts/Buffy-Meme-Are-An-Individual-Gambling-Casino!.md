#  Buffy Meme Bettors Can Now Gamble On The Future Of Slaying!

After the success of television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a new online gambling trend has emerged which allows fans to bet on the future of slaying. Meme Bettors can now gamble on whether Buffy and her friends will succeed in vanquishing their latest nemesis or not.
