#  What is the Black Gold game?

The Black Gold game is an online multiplayer game that allows players to explore the world of oil drilling. The game is set in the year 2020 and players can choose to be a part of one of two teams, the Red or the Blue team. The objective of the game is to drill for oil and sell it on the global market in order to make money. The game is played on a map that is made up of various states in the United States.

Players can choose to drill for oil in different states and each state has its own set of bonuses. For example, Texas offers bonuses for drilling in certain areas, while California offers bonuses for selling oil at specific terminals. In order to drill for oil, players must first purchase an oil rig and then they must place it in an area where they believe there is oil. Once the rig is in place, players can start drilling for oil by clicking on the rig.

While drilling for oil, players must be aware of two things; their fuel level and their water level. The fuel level decreases as the player drills for oil and if it runs out, the player will have to return to base to refill their tank. The water level increases as the player drills for oil and if it gets too high, the player will have to stop drilling until it goes down again.

Oil rigs can also be destroyed by other players or by environmental disasters such as tornadoes or earthquakes. When a rig is destroyed, the player must rebuild it before they can continue drilling for oil. The game also features a day/night cycle which affects how much money players can earn from selling their oil. At night, players earn more money per barrel than they do during the day.

The Black Gold game is free to play and can be downloaded from the official website.

#  How do you play the Black Gold game?

Black Gold is an addictive and complex strategy game that can be played by two to four players. The game board consists of a hexagonal grid with each player's home base in the centre. The aim of the game is to capture your opponent's home base, or to block their movement so they can't make any more moves.

There are five different types of pieces in Black Gold: troops, tanks, oil rigs, helicopters, and airfields. The troops are used to capture the opponent's home base, while the other pieces are used to defend your own base and block your opponent's movement.

Each player begins the game with six troops and a few other pieces depending on the number of players. The initial pieces are placed on the board at random. On a turn, a player can either move one piece or take an action with one piece. To move a piece, click on it and drag it to the new location. If you want to take an action with a piece, click on it and then select the action from the menu.

The possible actions are as follows:

- Move: You can move a piece one space forwards, backwards, or sideways. If you move into a space with an opponent's piece, that piece is captured and removed from the board.

- Attack: You can attack an opponent's piece that is adjacent to your own piece. If your attack is successful, the opponent's piece is captured and removed from the board.

- Build: You can build an oil rig, helicopter, or airfield by clicking on an empty space on the board and selecting "build". An oil rig costs two troops, a helicopter costs three troops, and an airfield costs four troops.

- Destroy: You can destroy an opponent's oil rig, helicopter, or airfield by clicking on it and selecting "destroy". A destroyed unit is removed from the board and cannot be rebuilt.
